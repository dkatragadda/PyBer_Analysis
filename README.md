# PyBer_Analysis

## Overview of the PyBer Analysis
The purpose of this analysis was to use our skills with pandas and matplotlib to perform data operations on a dataset containing information about ride sharing in different cities along with data on the city type, fares and driver count. This exercise involved merging two datasets (city data and ride data) to determine the metrics by city type and the fares. After processing the data, the objective was to visualize the dataframe using charts by leveraging the matplotlib package. 

## Results

### Overall summary of dataset shared

![Total_info_by_city_type](https://github.com/dkatragadda/PyBer_Analysis/blob/main/analysis/Total_info_by_city_type.png)

Based on the table above, the data shows that the urban cities earn the highest fares followed by the suburban cities and then the rural cities. The driver count is also the highest in the urban cities followed by suburban cities and rural cities respectively and the same pattern is observed for total rides as well. The order is inversed when we look at metrics such as average fare per ride or average fare per driver where it is the highest in the rural cities and gradually reduces in the urban cities.

### Deliverable 2: Plotting data for a sample of the dataset Jan 2019 to Apr 2019

The line chart denotes the total fares by city type when plotted against the month. As can be seen, the fares in the urban cities supercedes the fares in suburban or rural cities. 


## Summary

The three major recommendations to be proposed are:

1. Continue to maintain service levels in urban cities as they are the primary revenue drivers for the company.  
2. Focus on increasing the supply pool in rural cities as the driver count is low compared to the suburban and urban markets. 
3. Leverage the learnings from the urban cities to grow the suburban and rural markets as the average fare per ride and average fare per driver are higher.
